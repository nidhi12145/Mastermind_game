# ðŸŽ® Mastermind Game (Python)

A simple Python implementation of the classic **Mastermind** code-breaking game.  
The player has limited tries to guess the hidden sequence of colors chosen by the computer.

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Play
- The computer randomly generates a secret code of 4 colors.
- Valid colors are: `R, G, B, Y, W, O`  
  *(Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Orange)*  
- You have **10 tries** to guess the correct sequence.
- After each guess:
  - **Correct Positions** â†’ Number of colors that are correct and in the right position.  
  - **Incorrect Positions** â†’ Number of colors that are correct but in the wrong position.  

Your goal is to guess the exact code before you run out of tries!
